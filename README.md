# Company-Sales-Analysis
## Project Overview
The main objective of this project is to analyse the sales performance of a firm over a period of time for a growth-driven decision to be made. I also aim to identify the sales trend ,the category of the product that sells most. I also want to analyse the rating from the firm’s customers to know the performance of the firm. This analysis was conducted from scratch using MS EXCEL.
